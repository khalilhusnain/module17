## Introduction

Welcome to this tutorial on Regular Expressions (regex). This guide aims to help you understand a specific regex pattern by breaking down its components and explaining how each part works. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how the regex functions and how you can apply it in your web development projects.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we will be dissecting the following regex pattern:

/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

This pattern is commonly used for validating usernames. It ensures that the username is between 3 to 16 characters long and can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores.
